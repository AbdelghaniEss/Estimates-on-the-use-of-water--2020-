# Project Overview #

This is part of an assignment I worked on in ALX's Data Science Course. The data was in CSV format. I imported it into Google Sheets and performed many data cleaning tasks, along with creating visualizations to draw insights from it.

**Note that the project was uploaded in xlsx format so you will need to download it and then import it into Excel or google sheets to access it's content.**

**N.B**: The data used for this project is also available in the repository and it's in csv format.
